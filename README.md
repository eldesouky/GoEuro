# GoEuro
Integration of Objective C and Swift project practice. GoEuro mimc application

The app id compatible with iOS 7 and different iPhone screen sizes.

The project in Objective C with some Swift touches
Swift Files:

    - APIService.Swift
    - TripModel.swift
    - GoEuroSegmentedControl.Swift
    - SegmentCell.Swift
    - /Extensions

I used CocaPods to manage my used Libraries:

    - 'DZNEmptyDataSet': For handling TableViews when the data source doesn't contant any data
    - 'UIActivityIndicator-for-SDWebImage' : Handle loading the ImageView
    - 'SIAlertView': Customizable UIAlert View

I am a big fan of Alamofire and AFNetworking, but did really feel the need of using them in this case.
